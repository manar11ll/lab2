In this lab, we used Python and Pandas to analyze a telecom customer churn dataset. The goal was to understand customer behavior and identify which customers may leave the service. The dataset includes 7,043 customers and 21 features. We loaded the data and examined its shape, columns, and data types to better understand it before applying machine learning techniques.
